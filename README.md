# Motivation
I was playing Grow Castle alot in 2016, back then i always wanted to know how i could spend my gold, to get more damage faster, to be able to clear the waves faster.

So i started programming the Grow Castle Calculator, it is based on java and javafx.

# Features
-Create items and assign them to hereos and leaders

-Create Decks with Town Buildings, Treasures, Heroes, Leaders, Towers and Castle Components

-Calculate GoldPerDamage -> the less Gold spent per Damage the most effective

# Upcoming Features
-WIP
